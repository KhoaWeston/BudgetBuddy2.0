      <u1><form className="comp-container" style={{ marginLeft: "20px", marginRight: "20px", padding:"15px"}}>Financial stability is an important aspect of life. Many people who struggle to be financially stable donâ€™t have the required education on how to save and budget. Numerous companies have attempted to help these people by developing budgeting applications; however, many are too expensive and complicated for beginners. To improve on those areas, BudgetBuddy focuses on making a beginner-friendly and personalized budgeting application. It accomplishes this by only asking for any debts, savings, and incomes that the user may have and creates a budgeting model for them. The user can personalize this by adding any goals they may have and/or reminders they would like BudgetBuddy to send them.  </form></u1>
